# The XUI Framework

The XUI framework is a collection of user interface classes and helper modules for Xojo desktop projects. Many of the helper and utility modules (such as `MarkdownKit`) may be used in any Xojo project (e.g. console and iOS).

## Getting Started

1. Install the `TextInputCanvas` plugin into the Xojo plugins folder. This can be found in the `plugins` folder in your download. You can read more about this [on this page][plugin]. If the IDE is running whilst you do this, you will need to restart it.
2. Open the `XUI.xojo_project` file within the `src` folder in your download. This is the full [demo application][demo] available on the XUI website. It should provide you with a good overview of the framework's capabilities.

## Using XUI in your own projects

The easiest way to use XUI is to open up the demo project and copy the components you need from the `XUI` folder in the navigator. They are structured in an easy-to-understand manner.

Every method and property is documented with an IDE description so you'll get help at the bottom of the IDE when you hover over a symbol in the IDE. Every method is documented fully at the top of its code.

For comprehensive documentation on every component, please [read the documentation][docs].
