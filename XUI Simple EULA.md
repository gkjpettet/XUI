Inspired by Xojo's EULA, below is a simplified human-readable license for the use of XUI. It lays out what you are agreeing to when you use XUI in your projects. Clarity is provided in the full EULA.

You are free to:

- Use any of the modules and classes contained within the XUI download ("XUI") in any of your Xojo projects.
- Distribute your apps as compiled binaries without royalty or even recognition that you are using XUI.

With the understanding that:

- You cannot share / giveaway or sell the source code of any of the XUI modules or classes to anyone.
- Whilst the Xojo IDE provides the ability to "encrypt" modules and classes, you are explicitly prohibited from doing this with the XUI modules and classes.
- If tax must be paid for purchasing a XUI license and we didn't collect it then you are responsible for paying it.
- You won't create a derivative to sell or giveaway of any of the XUI controls, modules or classes.
